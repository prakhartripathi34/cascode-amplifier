   Open a terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of this Git repository.

   Example:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Cloned Directory**

   Move into the directory of the cloned project:

   ```bash

   ```

3. **Open Project Files in LTSpice**

   - Locate the `.asc` files (LTSpice schematic files) within the repository.
   - Double-click the desired `.asc` file to open it in LTSpice.

   Alternatively, you can open LTSpice, go to **File > Open**, and select the `.asc` file from the cloned repository folder.
