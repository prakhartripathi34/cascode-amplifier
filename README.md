Cascode Amplifier Design on LTSpice
This project features the design and simulation of a cascode amplifier using LTSpice, demonstrating its high gain and wide bandwidth characteristics. The repository includes the schematic and all necessary files to replicate the simulation.

How to Run the Simulation
Prerequisites
Install LTSpice from the official Analog Devices website.
Steps to Run
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cascode-amplifier-ltspice.git  
cd cascode-amplifier-ltspice  
Open the Schematic

Launch LTSpice.
Open the .asc file by navigating to File > Open and selecting the schematic from the cloned repository.
Verify Component Models

Ensure all component models are included.
For custom transistor models, make sure the .lib or .model file is in the same directory and linked correctly in the schematic.
Run the Simulation

Click the Run button (running man icon) or press Ctrl+R.
Choose the desired simulation type:
DC Analysis: To verify the operating point.
AC Analysis: To analyze frequency response and gain.
Transient Analysis: To observe dynamic behavior.
Analyze Results

Use the waveform viewer to inspect simulation outputs.
Add probes by clicking on circuit nodes to view voltage, current, or power waveforms.
Modify and Experiment

Change component values or configurations in the schematic to test various design parameters.
